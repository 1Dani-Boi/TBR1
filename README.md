Forked repository from Alex Whitesides because did not have permission to push files to that repository despite trying to fix that issue (GitHub takes a while to figure out sometimes).



This repository contains much of the tally code for visualizations and plotting functions associated with this. 


Dani Changes branch has the code for flux maps and the associated plotting that took quite some time to figure out on the HPC. This code is in the arc-standard file.

fml branch has many of the 2D plots and visualizations that were generated for the report, presentation, and expo. The code for this is in the backup_arc-standard.py file as well as the other .py files in the root directory such as ratiomap.py.
